### Bulletproof React Pattern

Each feature module in the `features/` directory is self-contained with its own:

- Components
- Hooks (if needed)
- Types (if needed)
- Utils (if needed)

This pattern promotes:

- **Separation of concerns** - Features are isolated and independent
- **Scalability** - Easy to add new features without affecting existing ones
- **Maintainability** - Clear organization makes code easier to understand
- **Reusability** - Shared components live in `components/`, feature-specific ones stay in their feature

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arkbusiness/inventory-web.git
cd inventory-web

npm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

The app uses Turbopack for fast refresh - changes are reflected instantly as you edit files.

### Build

```bash
# Create an optimized production build
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint
```

The project includes:

- **Husky** - Git hooks for pre-commit checks
- **lint-staged** - Runs linters on staged files
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **ESLint** - Code linting

Pre-commit hooks automatically:

- Format code with Prettier
- Lint and fix issues with ESLint
